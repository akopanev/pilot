# Input

Describe what you want to build. This is your raw description — the PRD step will transform it into structured requirements.

Be as specific or vague as you want. The more context you give, the better the PRD.

- **What** — what should the end result do?
- **Why** — what problem does this solve?
- **Constraints** — tech stack, compatibility, performance
- **Scope** — what's in, what's explicitly out

<!-- Example:

Add user authentication to the Express.js API.

Use JWT tokens, not sessions. Must work with existing PostgreSQL database.
No external auth providers (no OAuth/SAML).

In scope: signup, login, logout, password reset.
Out of scope: email verification, 2FA, admin roles.

The API currently has no auth — all endpoints are public.
User table already exists with email and password_hash columns.
